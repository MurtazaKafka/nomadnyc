Can you review clause 4.2 and confirm we're aligned on the revenue share adjustments?\n\nSpecifically, they're proposing:\n- 15% revenue share on first $1M\n- 12% on next $4M\n- 10% thereafter\n\nThis differs from our initial proposal. Please review ASAP as we need to close this round by Friday.\n\nBest,\nJane",
